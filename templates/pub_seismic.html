        <u>Experimental study on earthquake-induced falling debris of exterior infill walls and its impact to pedestrian evacuation</u>
    </h3>
    <p><b>Abstract: </b> Under the combined effects of in-plane deformation and out-of-plane acceleration during an earthquake, cracking occurs in the exterior infill walls of buildings causing debris to fall. The falling debris ineluctably blocks roads and hinders fast pedestrian evacuations. To identify the failure criterion for exterior infill walls, specialized test apparatus was designed, and pseudo-static experiments of infill walls were conducted in this work. The influences of different height-to-thickness ratios, drift ratios and out-of-plane accelerations on falling debris were taken into consideration in the proposed apparatus design. The experiment indicated that the infill blocks fell sooner and the falling area was larger for a thinner infill wall with a larger tilting angle. Based on the experimental results, a prediction model was proposed to evaluate the percentage of falling area of infill walls. Using the proposed failure criterion, a pedestrian evacuation simulation was conducted on the Tsinghua University campus as a case study. Moreover, the debris distribution and evacuation results under different earthquake intensities were also analyzed. The results of the case study revealed that a considerable area of roads located in densely built-up areas was covered by debris, resulting in a more than 30% increase in time for people in the nearby buildings to evacuate. Compared to the scenario without falling debris, the evacuation time with debris was 5% longer when subjected to MCE (Maximal Considered Earthquake). The proposed failure criterion for masonry infill walls can be employed in debris distribution calculation, which offers technical support for urban planning and evacuation drills.</p>

        <u>Study on seismic performance and collapse-resistant capacity of typical frame-core tube structures with single and dual lateral-force resisting system</u>
    </h3>
    <p><b>Abstract: </b> In the design code system of China, frame-core tube structure should be designed as a dual lateral-force resisting system, and there are strict requirements for the secondary lateral-force resisting system of such structure. In other words, the outer frame of the frame-core tube structure should have sufficient lateral stiffness and strength. However, in the design codes of other countries (e.g., ASCE-7 of the United States), the outer frame of the frame-core tube structure is permitted to only carry the vertical load. Therefore, to compare the seismic performances of the single and dual lateral-force resisting systems of the frame-core tube structure, a dual lateral-force resisting system model was firstly designed following the design codes of China. Subsequently, under the same gravity load (and the same concrete consumption), the single lateral-force resisting system model of the frame-core tube structure was design according to the following procedures: 1) the secondary lateral-force resisting system was removed from the dual system, and the shear force adjustment of the frame was ignored; 2) the seismic detailing requirement of the frame was lowered to reduce the sectional size. As a result, the tube beared most of the seismic load, and the frame only resisted the vertical load. The structural responses and component damage of these two systems under SLE (Service Level Earthquake) and MCE (Maximal considered earthquake) were analyzed. Furthermore, the collapse mechanisms of two structures and their collapse-resistances were investigated. Finally, the variation of the shear force and shear distribution of the frame under different levels of earthquake and the corresponding damage of key components were discussed. The research shows that the response of the dual system structure was slightly greater than that of the single system, and their collapse resistant capacities were similar. However, the steel consumption of the single system was less than that of the dual system.</p>

        <u>Experimental research and range of injury risk analysis of earthquake-induced hazard of falling exterior infill walls</u>
    </h3>
    <p><b>Abstract: </b> Earthquake-induced hazard of falling exterior infill walls is disastrous. Structural inter-story deformation and out-of-plane acceleration are the main factors induce damage and falling of infill walls. In order to study the mechanism of damage and falling of the infill walls under these two factors, a pseudo-static test of infill walls was designed in this paper. By placing the wall at different tilt angles, different out-of-plane accelerations of the infill walls during earthquake were simulated by using the acceleration component of gravity. Percentage of damage and falling area of the infill wall under different out-of-plane accelerations and in-plane drift is studied, and the fitting formula is provided. Then, aiming at RC-frame structure with exterior infill wall in different numbers of stories, the models of nonlinear structural analysis are established respectively to calculate the history response of acceleration, velocity and displacement of each floor. According to the maximum response of these structures and the experimental formula obtained from the test, the number of falling debris in different width-thickness ratio of infill wall and seismic acceleration is calculated, and the distribution of the debris after falling in projectile motion is calculated. Finally, according to the number and distribution of falling debris, the range of injury risk caused by damage and falling of the exterior infill walls under the earthquake is estimated. </p>

        <u>Seismic risk assessment of buildings in major Chinese cities based on the nonlinear time-history analysis of cities</u>
    </h3>
    <p><b>Abstract: </b> It is of profound significance to assess the national-scale seismic risk of urban buildings for seismic disaster prevention and mitigation. Based on the dynamic elasto plastic analysis of urban buildings, building seismic risk assessment of mainland cities was conducted in this work. First, the urban buildings database was established according to the macroscopic indicators provided by the Nation wide Census and China City Statistical Yearbook. Then, groundmotion intensities of the specific sites was obtained from the Global Earthquake Activity Rate Model (GEAR) method and the seismic groundmotion parameters zonation map of China. Then, site classifications of the cities were obtained using the corresponding relationship betweenthe ground slope and the shear wave velocity, through which the ground motion input could be further determined. Finally, based on the dynamic elastoplastic analysis of urban buildings, the seismic economic loss risk and extensive damage and collapse risk were assessed. Using the methods cited above, a map of building seismic risk of mainland citiesis given. The results showed that: (1) the method proposed in this work can assess the building seismic risk of mainland cities based on the publicly available data; (2) high seismic economic loss risk regions are mainly located in areas where the intensity of designbased earthquakes given by the 5th seismic groundmotion parameters zonation map of China is more than 0.3g; (3) after consideration of urban population and GDP, the building seismic risk of the eastern and central cities will increase significantly due to higher density of population and wealth; (4) differently selected groundmotion shave little impact on the seismic economic loss risk but has a greater impact on the extensive damage and collapse risk. The outcomes of this work can provide a useful method for future works on building seismic risk assessment of mainland cities. </p>
