        <u>Design and development of robotic collaborative system for automated construction of reciprocal frame structures</u>
    </h3>
    <p><b>Abstract: </b> Robotic technologies have shown their potential to improve efficiency, precision, and safety for construction tasks. In this paper, the concept of design for robotic construction (DfRC) is introduced, and robotic collaborative systems are developed for the construction of load-carrying structures. An automated structural assembly was achieved and demonstrated through robotics with a preference for reciprocal frame (RF) structures. Key innovations include the use of magnetic temporary connections to minimize offsets ofmobile robots and linear actuators as temporary supports during construction. Furthermore, specific procedures are formulated to navigate the robots and to target and install the components using a fiducial marker system and simultaneous localization and mapping packages, with consideration of structural deformation during construction due to self-weight. The successful assembly of a 4.5-m span RF structure demonstrates the potential of DfRC and the proposed robotic collaborative system in the automated construction of load-carrying structures.</p>

        <u>An integrated review of automation and robotic technologies for structural prefabrication and construction</u>
    </h3>
    <p><b>Abstract: </b> Building construction has developed from the use of primitive tools to that of machinery, with a tendency toward automation. Automation of processes and robotics can improve efficiency, accuracy and safety in construction. On the other hand, structural prefabrication for construction is increasingly being adopted worldwide to enhance productivity and to alleviate the environmental impact of conventional construction processes. The combination and application of automation and prefabrication technologies may therefore introduce new developments to the construction industry. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the use of automation technology for structural prefabrication and construction, including recent developments, challenges and future trends. Five stages following the sequence of construction are proposed: design, construction management, robotic manufacturing, autonomous transportation and automatic structural assembly. The paper concludes that the widespread use of automation technology is preferable to structural prefabrication for construction, and that the design for robotic construction introduced through connection innovations may be beneficial as a means of avoiding complex operations and thus improving the efficiency of robotic assembly processes.</p>

        <u>Automated assembly of reciprocal frame structures using robotics</u>
    </h3>
    <p><b>Abstract: </b> In this paper, the robotization of structural construction was studied in preference to the undemanding assembly of the reciprocal frame (RF) structures. Formulas were developed to automate the process of geometric forming and component evaluation. Subsequently, the robotic cooperative system was established to assemble the structure according to the positions and orientations of each component from the geometric forming module. The robotic system consists of two robotic arms, two navigating robots, depth cameras, and customized grippers. The structure was made from pultruded glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) members owing to their lightweight, high strength and corrosion resistance. Concepts of temporary connections were also proposed to eliminate the offset generated during the construction. Finally, the comparative studies of the constructions in different light environments and with different ground obstacles were investigated through experimental investigations. The results showed that the structure can be successfully assembled with the proposed robotic system and the assistance of the temporary connection in most of the light conditions and ground obstacles.</p>
