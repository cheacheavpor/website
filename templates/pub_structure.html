        <u>Geometric forming and mechanical performance of reciprocal frame structures assembled using fibre reinforced composites</u>
    </h3>
    <p><b>Abstract: </b> Reciprocal frame (RF) structures were developed in this work using pultruded glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) members and the formulation of mathematical model for geometric forming and capacity design of such structures were presented. Firstly, governing geometric relationships are identified for the height, span and slope of the RF structure and its overall geometry can be formed accordingly. Once the geometry is determined, the structure can be analysed to calculate the internal forces of each component and connections under given loads. GFRP pultruded members were used to assemble the RF structure due to their high strength and lightweight. Considering the closed shape of the tubular section and the anisotropy of the materials, an innovative connection configuration was developed to facilitate the assembly and minimise the requirement of tools in the construction. Both the conceptual design and modelling analysis are supported with experimental results at connection and structural levels. The load-drift relationships of the connections were experimentally examined. Subsequently, A GFRP reciprocal frame structure was then assembled with a span of 4.5 m and subjected to multi-point bending to verify the proposed evaluation method and to study its mechanical performance. Verified by experimental results, a two-dimensional numerical model of the RF structure was developed and analysed using the finite element (FE) approach where different structural boundary conditions and connection stiffnesses were discussed. Finally, the geometrical nonlinear analysis was also studied for the structure through FE modelling.</p>

        <u>Optimization design, manufacturing and mechanical performance of box girder made by carbon fiber-reinforced epoxy composites</u>
    </h3>
    <p><b>Abstract: </b> Optimization design and manufacturing play an important role in obtaining successful composite structures with high efficiency and safe use of materials. In this paper, we first present the optimization design procedure for a composite box girder by ANSYS para metric design language (APDL) in the ANSYS software. The input parameters used in the simulation work were determined via fundamental experimental tests of composite specimens. Then we manufactured the designed composite box girder by moldpressing prepreg technology according to the optimization results. The finial composite girder structure composed of arch top, web and bottom composite plate was obtained. The optimization procedure indicated that the use of stiffening plates in a girder could decrease the weight and increase the failure load. The location and ply mode of the stiffening plates in girder were suggested. The three-point-bending test was performed on the girder, and the test indicated that load-carrying capacity in unit mass of the optimized girder was as high as 107.8 N/g. Simulation and experimental results match well, and the maximum and minimum stresses in each layer were within the strength limitation of carbon material after optimized in the procedure.</p>
